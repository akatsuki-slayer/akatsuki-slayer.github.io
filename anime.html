                        My mom's from Japan, so as a kid I watched Studio Ghibli films like Princess
                        Monoke, Spirited Away, and Totoro. Side note: I rewatched these films in 
                        winter of 2021 and the first two were so good! Totoro was kind of a let down
                        for me as a young adult because there wasn't much of a plot, but I could see
                        how kids like the cuddly characters. Anyways, I watched American TV 
                        (Spongebob was my favorite show at the time), but I never got into anime. 
                        Even when I visited Japan as a kid, I would watch the shows I had heard of, 
                        like Powderpuff Girls, instead of Naruto. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward to college and two of my friends were anime fans. Anime fans get
                        a bad rap as being weirdos, so I was surprised. But that summer, when I had 
                        a lot of free time I decided I'd give it a try. The first show I watched was
                        Demon Slayer (see the main character, Tanjiro, in the top left). The first 
                        episode's tragedy made me tear up and the animation was so well done. 
                        Immediately, I texted my friends that this show was INSANE. I ended up 
                        watching that show with my mom, so I started watching Naruto while I was at
                        work, at my neighborhood pool. Since then, I've been hooked on anime and 
                        that's most of what I watch in my free time. I've always liked animated 
                        shows (i.e., Regular Show and Rick and Morty) and I'm Japanese-American so 
                        it makes sense why I like it so much. I've also been pressuring my other 
                        friends to at least give the medium a go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I've been asking my friends and looking at different rankings online 
                        (e.g., 
                        <a href="https://jw-webmagazine.com/best-anime/">JW Magazine</a> 
                        was the first one I looked at) to find the best anime to watch next. After 
                        persevering through over 500 episodes of Naruto, my strategy was to start
                        with classics and modern mega-hits that were also not 100s of episodes long
                        (i.e., not One Piece and Bleach). So without further ado, here are my 
                        anime lists. Note that the list of anime I've watched does not count any 
                        series which I started, but didn't get very far into (e.g., Clannad).
