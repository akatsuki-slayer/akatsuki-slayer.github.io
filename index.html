                        I'm from Woodbury, MN (suburb of St. Paul). I'm a rising junior at Vanderbilt 
                        University, double majoring in chemical engineering and math. I'm interested in 
                        a career in the tech industry.

                        I play for the men's club soccer team and serve as the secretary. I enjoy 
                        freestyling when I'm not practicing with the team.
                    </p>

                        Independent technical projects I've worked on include this landing page, an "Are 
                        You Smarter than a 5th Grader?" quiz game, a page showcasing my soccer freestyle
                        skills, and a page describing the anime I've watched. You can find links to 
                        these pages in the nav bar above.

                        In class, I've worked on many projects such as ... 
                        In my research I've worked on machine learning and data science projects 
                        that can predict the maximum number of C, H, N, O atoms in an organic compound, 
                        given a molar mass. This is one part of a larger program called MUISCA, created 
                        by and used in Dr. Jamey Young's lab at Vanderbilt University.
