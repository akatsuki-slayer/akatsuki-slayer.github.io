                        I'm from Woodbury, MN (suburb of St. Paul). I recently graduated summa cum 
                        laude from Vanderbilt University with a  double major in chemical 
                        engineering and applied math. I  minored in computer science, physics, and 
                        chemistry. I currently work as a software engineer at BlackRock in Atlanta. 
                        I made the decision to pursue this career path while I worked in a chemical 
                        engineering research lab the summer after my sophomore year.

                        Independent projects I've worked on include this static personal 
                        webpage and an "Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?" quiz game. The 
                        inspiration for this game came from 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=are+you+smarter+than+a+5th+grader+college" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                        of the original TV series. YouTubers go to college campuses 
                        and ask students relatively simple questions and it's really entertaining 
                        when the students get them wrong. You can find links to these pages in the nav bar 
                        above. This website was made with HTML and CSS, and is hosted on 
                        Github Pages. The quiz game was made using React and CSS.

                        I performed research in Dr. Jamey Young's lab in the Department of 
                        Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Vanderbilt from January 2022 through
                        September 2022. The lab focuses on metabolic engineering, and I focused on 
                        cyanobacteria in particular. I performed cyanobacterial genetic 
                        transformation, metabolite extraction and derivatization, GCMS, and GCMS 
                        data analysis. 
                        I also worked with another PhD student on a machine learning side project.

                        In my freetime, I enjoy playing soccer, working out, and trying new 
                        restaurants in Atlanta. My other interests include chess, poker, cooking, 
                        interior design, smellmaxxing, and keeping up with the news/politics.
