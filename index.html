                        I'm from Woodbury, MN (suburb of St. Paul). I'm a rising junior at Vanderbilt 
                        University, double majoring in chemical engineering and applied math. I am
                        also minoring in computer science, physics, and chemistry. My goal is to
                        become a software engineer. I made this decision at the beginning of this 
                        summer (2022), so I have been practicing LeetCode problems and learning 
                        about web development these past couple months. Relevant coursework includes
                        data structures, discrete math, intermediate software design, digital 
                        systems, and linear algebra.

                        Independent projects I've worked on include this static personal 
                        webpage with links to subpages showcasing my research (more on that later) 
                        and some of my other hobbies, and an "Are You Smarter than 
                        a 5th Grader?" quiz game. The inspiration for this game came from 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=are+you+smarter+than+a+5th+grader+college" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                        of the original TV series. YouTubers go to college campuses 
                        and ask students relatively simple questions and it's really entertaining 
                        when the students get them wrong. You can find links to these pages in the nav bar 
                        above. This website was made with HTML and CSS, and is hosted on 
                        Github Pages. The quiz game was made using ReactJS and CSS and
                        is hosted on Heroku.

                        I've been doing research in Dr. Jamey Young's lab in the Department of 
                        Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Vanderbilt since January 2022 and
                        I'm continuing it over this summer. Our lab focuses on metabolic 
                        engineering, and my group (two PhD students and I) focuses on 
                        cyanobacteria in particular. I perform cyanobacterial genetic 
                        transformation, metabolite extraction and derivatization, GCMS, and GCMS 
                        data analysis. 
                        I'm also working with another PhD student on a coding side project, 
                        involving machine learning, data mining, and other data science techniques.

                        In my freetime, I play for the men's club soccer team and serve as the 
                        secretary. When I'm not practicing with the team, I enjoy practicing juggling 
                        tricks. I like strength training and running as well. My hobbies that don't 
                        involve physical activity include watching anime, cooking, and keeping up 
                        with the news/politics.
