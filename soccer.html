                    I've been playing soccer since around the age of 5. I didn't start playing at the 
                    competitive level until around the age of 10. I remember back in 2nd grade or so, my
                    maximum consecutive juggles was 7. I landed the "around the world (atw)," one 
                    of the most basic juggling tricks, in 9th grade. I practiced juggling a little in my
                    free time, but rarely tricks or dribbling or finishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played on my high school's varsity team all four years and we got second in the 
                    state tournament my senior year. I was also named all-conference. 
                    Up until summer 2021 I could only do the rainbow and inside/outside atw. Since club 
                    sports were cancelled my freshman year of college due to COVID, I wanted to get a 
                    lot of touches on the ball that summer, before tryouts. I worked at my neighborhood 
                    pool and had a lot of freetime outdoors, so I practiced juggling tricks for about an 
                    hour a day all summer long. I learned the crossover, hop the world, neck stall, 
                    Homie Touzani around the world (htatw), Touzani around the world (tatw), knee catch,
                    and replay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up making the club soccer team; the acceptance rate at tryouts was 
                    roughly 15%. I am currently serving as the secretary.
