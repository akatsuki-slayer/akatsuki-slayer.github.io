                        I've been playing soccer since around the age of 5. I remember back in 2nd grade 
                        or so, my maximum consecutive juggles was 7. I didn't start playing at the 
                        competitive level until around the age of 10. I landed the "around the world (atw)," one 
                        of the most basic juggling tricks, in 9th grade. Back then, I practiced juggling 
                        a little in my free time, but rarely tricks or dribbling or finishing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I played on my high school's varsity team all four years and we got second in the 
                        state tournament my senior year. I was also named all-conference that year. 
                        Up until summer 2021 I could only do the rainbow and inside/outside atw. Since club 
                        sports were cancelled my freshman year of college due to COVID, I wanted to get a 
                        lot of touches on the ball that summer, before tryouts the next fall. I worked at my neighborhood 
                        pool and had a lot of freetime outdoors, so I practiced juggling tricks for about an 
                        hour a day all summer long. I learned the crossover, hop the world, neck stall, 
                        Homie Touzani around the world (htatw), Touzani around the world (tatw), knee catch,
                        and replay.

                        I played really well at tryouts and in between drills I showed off the tricks I 
                        added to my arsenal over the summer. My friends told me that the guys evaluating 
                        us noticed and jotted stuff down on their clipboards. After three consecutive 
                        cuts I ended up making the team; the acceptance rate at tryouts was 
                        roughly 15%. I'm now currently serving as the secretary and one of my 
                        responsibilities is running our
