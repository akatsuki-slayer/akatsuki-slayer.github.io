                I've been playing soccer since around the age of 5. I didn't start playing at the 
                competitive level until around the age of 10. I remember back in 2nd grade or so, my
                maximum consecutive juggles was 7. I landed the "around the world (atw)," one 
                of the most basic juggling tricks, in 9th grade. I practiced juggling a little in my
                free time, but rarely tricks or dribbling or finishing.

                I played on my high school's varsity team all four years and we got second in the 
                state tournament my senior year. I was also named all-conference. Since coming to 
                Vanderbilt, I've joined the club team and am currently serving as the secretary.

                Up until summer 2021 I could only do the rainbow and inside/outside atw. Since club 
                sports were cancelled my freshman year of college due to COVID, I wanted to get a 
                lot of touches on the ball that summer, before tryouts. I worked at my neighborhood 
                pool and had a lot of freetime outdoors, so I practiced juggling tricks for about an 
                hour a day all summer long. I learned the crossover, hop the world, neck stall, 
                Homie Touzani around the world (htatw), Touzani around the world (tatw), knee catch,
                and replay.
